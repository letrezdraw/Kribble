# 🎨 Doodle

> **The backend server for an online multiplayer drawing and guessing game (Pictionary) built with modern web technologies.**

The Doodle server powers the real-time, multiplayer gameplay of the Doodle app. It handles communication between players using **Socket.IO**, ensures synchronization of the game state, and implements core game logic.

_The client side code can be found at https://github.com/Experimentf/doodle-client_

## 🚀 Features

- ⚡ **Real-time Communication:** Leverages **Socket.IO** for real-time, low-latency interactions between clients.
- 🔄 **Game State Management:** Handles game room setups, player turns, drawing events, and scores.
- ✅ **Scalable Architecture:** Built with **Node.js** and **TypeScript** for clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
- 🔒 **Environment Configuration:** Securely configures sensitive data with `.env` files.
- ⚙️ **Customizable Events:** Easily extendable Socket.IO event handlers for custom logic.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

A modern backend stack powers the server:

- **Node.js:** Runtime environment for the server.
- **TypeScript:** Strongly typed programming for reliability and maintainability.
- **Socket.IO:** Enables bidirectional communication between the client and server.
- **dotenv:** Manages configuration via environment variables.

## 💻 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js (>= 16.x):** [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (Comes with Node.js)

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Experimentf/doodle-server.git
   cd doodle-server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project to configure the server environment:

   ```env
   PORT=5000
   CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
   DOODLE_CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

   `CLIENT_URL`, `DOODLE_CLIENT_URL`, and `NETLIFY_DOODLE_CLIENT_URL` are merged (comma-separated lists allowed). If none are set, CORS defaults to `*`. Replace `http://localhost:3000` with your real client origin in production.

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. The server will be up and running at `http://localhost:5000`.

## 📡 Socket.IO Features

The server facilitates real-time communication between multiple clients through **Socket.IO**.

### Key Events & Handlers
- All the socket events being handled are specified [here](https://github.com/Experimentf/doodle-server/blob/main/src/constants/events/socket.ts)

The Socket.IO event system is modular and supports creating custom events to extend functionality.

## 🛡️ Environment Variables

| Variable      | Description                       | Default Value           |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `PORT`        | Port the server runs on           | `5000`                  |
| `CLIENT_URL` | Comma-separated allowed browser origins (CORS + Socket.IO) | (see `.env.example`) |
| `DOODLE_CLIENT_URL` | Legacy client origin (merged with `CLIENT_URL`) | `http://localhost:3000` |
| `NETLIFY_DOODLE_CLIENT_URL` | Extra allowed origin (merged) | — |

Add these variables to a `.env` file in the root directory for local development.

---

## 📦 Deployment

### Build for Production
To build the server for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

The compiled files will be output to the `dist/` directory.

### Run the Production Server
After building the project, start the server using:

```bash
npm run dev
```
