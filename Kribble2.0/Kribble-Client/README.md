## 📡 Socket.IO Integration

The Doodle client heavily relies on **Socket.IO** for real-time communication with the server. Key features powered by Socket.IO include:

- Broadcasting live drawing data to other users.
- Sending and receiving chat messages.
- Synchronizing the game state (player turns, guesses, and scores).
